## System Design

### Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with React, using a centralized state management approach in the App component. The system is designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible.

### Key Components

1. **App (App.jsx)**: The main container component that manages application state and data flow
2. **QueryEditor**: Handles SQL input, query execution, and provides syntax highlighting
3. **ResultsTable**: Displays query results with sorting, pagination, and search capabilities
4. **Sidebar**: Provides navigation between tables, query history, and saved queries
5. **Navbar**: Application header with branding and navigation links

### Data Flow

1. User selects a table or enters a custom SQL query
2. The App component processes the query and loads the appropriate data
3. Data is parsed from CSV files using PapaParse
4. Processed data is passed to the ResultsTable component for display
5. Query history is updated and displayed in the Sidebar

### ER Diagram (Conceptual Model)

The application works with the following database schema:

```
+-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
|   Products  |     |    Orders   |     |  Suppliers  |
+-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
| ProductID   |<----| OrderID     |     | SupplierID  |
| ProductName |     | CustomerID  |     | CompanyName |
| SupplierID  |---->| EmployeeID  |     | ContactName |
| CategoryID  |     | OrderDate   |     | Address     |
| UnitPrice   |     | RequiredDate|     | City        |
| UnitsInStock|     | ShippedDate |     | Region      |
+-------------+     | ShipVia     |---->+-------------+
                    | Freight     |     
                    +-------------+     +-------------+
                                        |   Shippers  |
                    +-------------+     +-------------+
                    |   Regions   |     | ShipperID   |
                    +-------------+     | CompanyName |
                    | RegionID    |     | Phone       |
                    | RegionDesc  |     +-------------+
                    +-------------+     
                          ↑             
                    +-------------+     
                    | Territories |     
                    +-------------+     
                    | TerritoryID |     
                    | Description |     
                    | RegionID    |-----+
                    +-------------+     
```

## Design Decisions

- **DataGrip-like Interface**: The application mimics the look and feel of DataGrip, a popular database IDE used by data professionals
- **No Backend**: As per requirements, the application doesn't have a backend or query validation, focusing on frontend functionality
- **Predefined Data**: The application uses CSV files as the data source, allowing for realistic data interaction
- **User Experience**: Focus on creating a smooth experience for data analysts who would use this tool all day
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with consistent styling and responsive design
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data handling and rendering for large result sets

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Query Validation**: Implement real-time SQL syntax checking and error highlighting
- **Interactive Database Schema**: Visual schema explorer with relationship diagrams
- **Export Functionality**: Export query results to various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- **Query Optimization Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for query performance
- **Collaborative Features**: Share queries and results with team members
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support for reduced eye strain during extended use
- **Query Templates**: Customizable templates for common query patterns
- **Advanced Filtering**: Column-specific filters and advanced search capabilities
- **Data Visualization**: Integrated charts and graphs for query results
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for power users
